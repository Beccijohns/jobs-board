  This opening is a rare opportunity to help run a new type of research
  non-profit and contribute to the developing quantum technology ecosystem.

  Unitary Fund is a 501(c)(3) non-profit research group helping build a quantum technology industry that benefits the most people. We support the community, e.g., running a grant program to support the development of new open source quantum software, and we do our own research on key projects for the ecosystem.

  This is a unique opportunity to have a direct impact on the growth of the quantum open source ecosystem and the tools that Unitary Fund is developing. Weâ€™re hiring a Community Manager to help oversee the organization and execution of a diverse array of community building activities, including the Mitiq open-source community activities, Quantum Wednesdays talk series, hackathons, workshops, as well as ongoing resources like the Unitary Fund Discord Server, community surveys, newsletters and blog.

  You will build sustainable and community-oriented open source practices to ensure the tools of the quantum ecosystem reach more people, sooner. This includes development and execution of in-person and online events, as well as outreach strategies to build new audiences and ensure support for existing users. You will work with a diverse array of community members including Unitary Fund Donors, Ambassadors, Advisory Board Members, Grantees, users advocates and more. This position is full time with a competitive salary range, commensurate with experience. Unitary Fund is a fully remote team and this role is also remote.
