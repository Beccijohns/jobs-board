  This opening is a rare opportunity to help run a new type of research
  non-profit and contribute to the developing quantum technology ecosystem.

  Unitary Fund is a 501(c)(3) non-profit working to create a quantum
  technology ecosystem that benefits the most people.
  We run a grant program to support new open source quantum tech,
  and we fund our own research on key projects for the ecosystem.


  Weâ€™re looking for a proactive generalist who can contribute and learn
  across the organization. They will work directly with the President and
  the CTO to manage and scale processes and projects.

  Examples can include scaling our microgrant process, raising funds from
  new supporters, managing our bounty programs and hackathons,
  bringing on new partner organizations and new geographies,
  contracting a new website build, and other special projects.

  This role encompasses work across multiple aspects of the organization
  (microgrants and Unitary Labs) and will require a strongly organized
  individual to surface priorities, triage needs, communicate continuously,
  nd know when to ask for help. This position will work closely with
  Unitary Fund leadership and have opportunities to develop their own
  leadership as well. We are looking for someone excited to take ownership
  of the projects that they work on.
