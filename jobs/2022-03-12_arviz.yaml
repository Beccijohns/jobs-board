  Dataviz is a key part of any statistical or data science job, and Bayesian
  models are not an exception. ArviZ provides tools for Exploratory Analysis
  of Bayesian Models, from diagnostics and summary statistics to bespoke
  visualizations.

  We are searching for someone to analyze the current state of available
  plots to identify missing visualizations, defaults not following bad
  practices and missing references in the documentation and write a
  report with the findings and recommendations. The report will be published
  in hopes it also helps other dataviz libraries.

  The full job description and application process is available on
  [our GitHub](https://github.com/arviz-devs/GSoD/blob/main/2021/viz_evaluation.md)
