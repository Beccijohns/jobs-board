  [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) is a free and open source scientific 
  environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for 
  scientists, engineers and data analysts. It features a unique combination 
  of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality 
  of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive 
  execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities of a 
  scientific package.

  We are looking for someone to help us improve the installation experience 
  for the Spyder IDE Windows users, by enabling the current standalone 
  installers available to be auto-updatable and providing a way to install 
  custom packages that are not bundled with the installers in a simpler way.

  The full job/project description and application process is available on 
  [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTUQDK4zrmwJ0E_KQehqmAjWWBFM8aJSlxCOY4m8k64pYnhYn81OMg6VaCPKXdx3DHjbSbxWjOlUMEs/pub)
